  Now both CAMF and image decoding are correct for TRUE engine stuff!!

x3f_029 Roland 2010-07-29
  CAMF type 4 is working
  Need to fix the image decompression so it also gets correct

x3f_028 Roland 2010-07-27
  CAMF type 4 is nearly working - most data is correct.
  The TRUE RAW decoding is affected by the CAMF decoding and not fixed.

x3f_027 Roland 2010-07-21
  Fixed so the TRUE engine RAW decoding is Bayer CFA style,
  i.e. odd and even pixels are decoded separately on each line.

x3f_026 Roland 2010-07-21
  Some more steps towards reading CAMF type 4

x3f_025 Roland 2010-07-19
